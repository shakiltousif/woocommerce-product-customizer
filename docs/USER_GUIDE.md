## Frequently Asked Questions
- Can I add multiple logos? Yes. After the first, use "Add another logo to this item" from cart.
- Can I add text instead of a logo? Yes if enabled by the store; text is treated like a lightweight logo with its own setup.
- Do setup fees apply every time? Setup is typically one‑time per logo; the store can mark a saved logo as setup‑fee paid.
- How do bulk discounts work? Quantity‑based tiers lower the per‑item application charge as quantity increases (see pricing table).
